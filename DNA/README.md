# DNA (Python)
This is a Python-based program designed to identify individuals based on their DNA sequences. It reads a DNA sequence and a database of STR (Short Tandem Repeats) counts for a list of individuals, then identifies the individual most likely associated with the DNA. This project exemplifies proficiency in Python, algorithmic thinking, and working with extensive data sets.
