# Finance (Full-stack web app)
This is a web application that allows users to simulate stock trading by "buying" and "selling" stocks. Developed with Python using the Flask framework, it employs SQLite for database management, and HTML/CSS for front-end design. Users can register accounts, check real-time stock prices, manage their stock portfolio, and view transaction history.
