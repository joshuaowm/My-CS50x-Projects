# My CS50x Projects
Welcome to my **CS50x** project portfolio, a testament to my journey of learning and exploration through the prestigious CS50x course by Harvard University. In this repository, you'll discover a curated selection of my projects, each exemplifying my expertise in computer science and programming.

## About CS50
**CS50** is a renowned course from Harvard University, offering an immersive and challenging learning experience in computer science and programming. Through a series of rigorous problem sets and engaging lectures, I've cultivated a strong foundation in these fields and applied my knowledge to create real-world projects, transforming into a well-rounded developer.

## Project Highlights
- **Tideman (C)**
  A command-line application that replicates a Tideman ranked-choice voting system. The program takes voters' candidate rankings, calculates the winner via pairwise comparisons, and adeptly handles preference cycles. This project was coded in C, showcasing my mastery of algorithms, data structures, and memory management.

- **DNA (Python)**
  A Python-based program designed to identify individuals based on their DNA sequences. It reads a DNA sequence and a database of STR (Short Tandem Repeats) counts for a list of individuals, then identifies the individual most likely associated with the DNA. This project exemplifies my proficiency in Python, algorithmic thinking, and working with extensive data sets.

- **Finance (Full-stack web app)**
  A web application that allows users to simulate stock trading by "buying" and "selling" stocks. Developed with Python using the Flask framework, it employs SQLite for database management, and HTML/CSS for front-end design. Users can register accounts, check real-time stock prices, manage their stock portfolio, and view transaction history.
